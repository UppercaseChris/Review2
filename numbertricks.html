            So this one kinda went off the rails. I'm running short on time so I haven't made any changes to the overall apperance of the site, however after your suggestions I recieved the other day
            and my personal disgust towards the overall design I plan on fully revamping this project as a whole. This one was tricky yet simplistic. I choose to externally link the JavaScript for the sake of keeping the 
            individual types of code seperate (or as I like to say I segregated them). Than it was a matter of breaking down the process. First using a prompt() command it allowed access to user input, asking for a whole number to be enter (1. without any explaination towards the game and 2. without any checks to confirm that the value being enter is indeed an integer.).
            I than used the parseInt() command to convert the string value into an integer value, provided that's possible. Step 2 was more straight forward, simply work that number through a series of equations to obtain the final result, which in this case should always be 7.
            Knowing that I was going to be displaying the result of each calculation I created a variable to hold the new value for the original number entered. Than I used that variable to begin the next equation.
            That part for me was simple, something I'm familiar with overall. Displaying the information was a bit trickier but I managed to make it work. By using the document.write() command I was able to get everything onto the webpage that I needed.
            During this I found out that when you're printing html tags, the tags themselves will become active, and because part of the criteria was to print the results in list format, there was no need to use the writeIn command since the li tag
            automatically places a new line. Plus it's easily managable through CSS. I made sort of a replay link. However I didn't do it using JavaScript so I'm not expecting extra credit. In my
            HTML document, after I ran the script I placed an a ref link back to this page connected to the Play Again text. When we do the upgraded version of this I want to explore that concept further however functionally speaking I believe this work is sufficent for time being.
